# Development Session Summary
Date: 2025-08-18

## Objective
Refactor and stabilize the internet monitoring tool by unifying analysis logic, improving alert output, adding richer metrics & tests, and introducing flexible operation modes (analyze-only vs collection) with sensible defaults.

## Key Changes Completed
1. Unified Analysis Logic
   - Moved / deduplicated batch aggregation & comparison into `analysis/analysis.go` (AnalyzeRecentResultsFull).
   - Legacy map-based parsing & synthetic run_tag derivation REMOVED; only typed v3 envelopes with explicit run_tag are supported.

2. Reconstructed `main.go`
   - Rewritten after corruption: flags, worker pool, run_tag handling, alert evaluation, JSON report writing.
   - Added helper `deriveDefaultAlertsPath` to place auto alert reports at repo root.

3. Alert JSON Improvements
   - Consistent schema (`alerts` always an array, `single_batch` flag on first batch only case).
   - Extended metrics included: first RTT goodput, p50 throughput, p99/p50 ratio, plateau stats, jitter.
   - Default behavior (no `--alerts-json`):
     * Analyze-only mode: writes `alerts_<last_run_tag>.json` for newest batch.
     * Collection mode: writes per-iteration `alerts_<run_tag>.json`.

4. New Analyze-Only Mode (Default)
   - Flags: `--analyze-only` (default true), `--analysis-batches` (default 10).
   - Skips site loading & measurement; parses existing `monitor_results.jsonl` only.
   - Maintains same alert evaluation path; supports auto-named alert report.

5. Collection Mode Enhancements
   - Per-iteration analysis with capped recent batch window (up to iterations or max N) after each iteration.
   - Same summary print format across modes.

6. Test Coverage
   - Existing: `analysis_test.go` (baseline comparisons), `monitor_test.go` (serialization).
   - Added: `analysis_extended_test.go` (extended metrics aggregation) updated to rely solely on typed envelopes.
   - All tests currently passing.

7. Documentation Updates
   - README expanded: dual modes, new flags, default alert JSON behavior, schema examples.
   - Added rich top-of-file and function-level comments in `main.go`.

## Current Behavior Snapshot
- Default invocation (`go run ./src/main.go`) => analyze-only mode over last 10 batches (or fewer if not present) using existing JSONL file.
- To collect fresh data: `--analyze-only=false` plus site/iteration/parallel flags.
- Auto alert report written to repo root unless `--alerts-json` provided.

## File Additions / Notable Mods
- `src/main.go` (major rewrite + analyze-only mode + comments)
- `src/analysis/analysis_extended_test.go` (new tests)
- README.md (multiple sections updated: TL;DR, flags, alert JSON report)
- `DEV_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Metrics & Alerts Logic Recap
- Speed drop: negative delta >= threshold.
- TTFB increase: positive delta >= threshold.
- Error rate: (error_lines / lines)*100 >= threshold.
- Jitter: aggregated average >= threshold.
- p99/p50 ratio: aggregated average >= threshold.
- Aggregation for comparison: newest batch vs average of all previous batches in window.

## Edge Cases Handled
- Single batch => no comparison metrics; `single_batch:true` in JSON.
- Empty / no batches in analyze-only mode => graceful message, exit.

## Potential / Suggested Next Steps
1. Add unit test for `writeAlertJSON` (schema validation + default auto-naming logic via temp dir + run_tag injection).
2. Parameterize max batches for per-iteration analysis (currently tied to iterations or hard-coded 10 in collection path).
3. Add optional Prometheus exporter or metrics print (toggle via flag) for integration with monitoring stacks.
4. Implement rolling log rotation for `monitor_results.jsonl` (size or batch count based) and auto-prune.
5. Introduce configuration file (YAML/TOML/JSON) for thresholds & operational flags to reduce CLI complexity.
6. Add anomaly detection scoring (e.g. z-score on speed/ttfb) to supplement fixed thresholds.
7. Include percentiles (p90/p95) in alert JSON if needed for gating decisions.
8. Parallel analysis optimization: if file large, stream parse only last N batches (currently na√Øve full scan if large?).
9. Optional site include/exclude filtering in analyze-only mode.
10. Generate run summary trend sparkline or small textual sparkline for avg_speed across batches.

## Known Limitations / Trade-offs
- Alert comparison uses simple average of prior batches (no weighting / recency decay).
- Jitter currently averaged per batch; may want distribution percentiles later.
- Auto alert JSON naming may overwrite if two analyses run in the same second (same run_tag); run_tag includes second granularity.
- No direct test of analyze-only flag path yet (could add integration test capturing stdout & output files).
- Older pre-v3 result files require external migration (legacy parsing removed).

## Open Questions (If Revisited Later)
- Should analyze-only remain default long term? (Documented as temporary default.)
- Add environment variable overrides for defaults? (E.g. ANALYZE_ONLY=false)
- Provide machine-readable exit codes on alert conditions (e.g. non-zero if any alert) for CI gating.

## How to Resume
- If adding new metrics: update `BatchSummary` in analysis package, extend aggregation loops, include fields in `writeAlertJSON`, add tests.
- If adjusting threshold logic: modify evaluation blocks in both analyze-only section (in `main.go`) and `performAnalysis` for parity.
- To extend maximum batch window logic: factor out repeated comparison code into a shared helper to DRY paths.

## Command Reference
Collect 2 iterations with alerts:
```
go run ./src/main.go --analyze-only=false --iterations 2 --parallel 3 \
  --speed-drop-alert 25 --ttfb-increase-alert 40
```
Analyze last 5 batches only:
```
go run ./src/main.go --analysis-batches 5
```
Force writing named alert JSON while analyzing:
```
go run ./src/main.go --alerts-json custom_alerts.json
```
