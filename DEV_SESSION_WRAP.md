# Session Wrap — 2025-08-24

## goals
- Make the viewer’s crosshair/labels clean, readable, and accurate; remove misleading snapping/highlights.
- Persist crosshair state and polish axes (nice time ticks, units, relative/absolute Y).
- Fix incomplete batch loading and fragile situation filtering.
- Leave the project easy to resume with clear Reader/Viewer docs separate from monitor/analyzer.

## highlights
- Crosshair UX: subtle theme-aware lines + dot + label on semi-transparent bg; no X-band highlight; hidden outside drawn image rect.
- Time axis: rounded, readable ticks via pickTimeStep/makeNiceTimeTicks while plotting with true timestamps.
- Stability: switched to a dynamic JSONL reader (no fixed token cap) with a defensive 200MB per-line limit; propagated Situation into batch summaries to avoid rescans.
- Filtering: Situation selection defaults to All; mapping is derived from summaries, not by rescanning the file.
- Docs/Separation: Added focused READMEs and REQUIREMENTS for Reader/Viewer; introduced a tiny iqmreader CLI.

## key changes by component

### iqmviewer (cmd/iqmviewer)
- Derives run_tag → Situation mapping from analysis summaries; removed obsolete file rescan helper.
- Crosshair overlay:
  - Vertical/horizontal lines follow the mouse; dot at intersection; semi-transparent label background.
  - Hidden when cursor leaves the actual drawn image area (ImageFillContain aware).
  - Crosshair enabled state persists across restarts.
- X-axis modes: Batch, RunTag, Time with nice ticks; point-only series; responsive chart width.
- Y-scale: Absolute/Relative; speed unit conversions (kbps/kBps/Mbps/MBps/Gbps/GBps).
- After load, logs per-situation batch counts to aid verification.

### analysis (src/analysis)
- AnalyzeRecentResultsFull:
  - Scanner buffer: 8MB (prevents truncated scans of large JSONL lines).
  - Carries meta.situation into records; each BatchSummary has Situation populated deterministically.
  - Groups by run_tag; sorts lexicographically and trims to last N batches.

### reader CLIs
- iqmreader (cmd/iqmreader):
  - Flags: -file, -n, -situation.
  - Prints total batches and counts by Situation ("(none)" when missing).
- iqminspect (cmd/iqminspect): retained; quick batch-count inspector (superseded by iqmreader with filtering).

## verification
- Tests: src/analysis tests PASS.
- Builds: iqmviewer, iqmreader build on macOS.
- Sanity: Current dataset → Total batches: 19; Home_CorporateLaptop_CorpProxy_SequencedTest: 18; atHome_CorpLaptop_CorpProxy_ParallelTest_8: 1.

## known constraints
- A "batch" == unique run_tag. Many result lines with the same run_tag count as one batch.
- Time axis uses strictly increasing timestamps parsed from run_tag (with _iN suffix offset handling).

## how to resume quickly
- Viewer: `go build ./cmd/iqmviewer` then `./iqmviewer -file monitor_results.jsonl`.
- Reader: `go build ./cmd/iqmreader` then `./iqmreader -file monitor_results.jsonl -n 10000` (optionally add `-situation ...`).
- In the viewer, pick a Situation from the dropdown; console logs show per-situation batch counts after load to confirm coverage.

## next steps (optional)
- Add richer CLI summaries (avg speed/TTFB per situation) and a small status bar in the viewer with batch counts.
- Add unit tests for time tick generation edge cases.
- Document run_tag timestamp encoding and _iN offset rules in README_iqmviewer.md.
